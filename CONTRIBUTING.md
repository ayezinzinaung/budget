# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Here's how to.

## Reporting Bugs

Check whether or not there's an existing issue on the bug you're trying to report. If there aren't any issues, go ahead and create one.

## Building Features or Fixing Bugs

1. Fork
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name
3. Get to work, soldier
4. Commit (your message has to start capitalized and be written in the imperative)
5. Open a pull request
6. And now we play the waiting game (just wait for someone to review your PR)
